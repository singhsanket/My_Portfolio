            Hello, I'm Sanket Singh!
A passionate and driven individual with a keen interest in technology and innovation, I completed my schooling at Authpur Nation Model HS School in 2019, specializing in Computer Science. This early exposure to the world of technology sparked my curiosity and laid the foundation for my career in engineering.

graduated with a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) at the prestigious West Bengal University of Technology, graduate in 2024. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been exploring the dynamic intersection between hardware, software, and digital communications, with a focus on building solutions that drive progress.

I’m a problem-solver at heart, constantly looking for opportunities to apply my skills in real-world settings. Whether it’s through coding, working on innovative tech projects, or collaborating with like-minded individuals, I’m always eager to learn, grow, and contribute to the tech community. My educational background, paired with my enthusiasm for new technologies, has equipped me with a solid foundation to make an impact in the world of tech.

Let's connect and explore the exciting possibilities of the digital future! Feel free to reach out—I’m always open to collaborating, learning, and sharing ideas.

            <h3> Bank Management Model </h3>
            <p>
                The Bank Management System is a Java-based desktop application that helps manage a bank’s operations efficiently. The project is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database connectivity, and MySQL as the backend database to store account details, transactions, and other necessary data. This system simulates real-life banking operations, allowing users to manage accounts, perform transactions, and track their account balances.

            <h3> Heart Disease Prediction Model </h3>
            <p>
                A Heart Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of an individual developing heart disease based on various factors and medical data. The model uses historical data of patients, including their health attributes, to classify whether they are at high risk of heart disease.

               <bold>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</bold> 
This simple yet classic game allows users to play against the computer using the well-known mechanics of Rock, Paper, and Scissors. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, where the user’s choice is compared to the computer’s, and the winner is determined based on the rules. I focused on creating a responsive and engaging UI with HTML and CSS, adding animations and sound effects to enhance the user experience.
<br>
<bold>Tic Tac Toe Game</bold>
A fully interactive Tic Tac Toe game where players can take turns playing against each other. I used JavaScript to handle the game’s logic, such as checking for win conditions, managing turns, and resetting the game. HTML and CSS were used to design a clean and visually appealing game board, ensuring it’s intuitive and user-friendly for players.
<br>
<bold>Weather Application</bold>
This weather app allows users to input their location and get real-time weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. By integrating a weather API, I was able to fetch accurate data and display it dynamically on the front-end. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were utilized to create a responsive and visually appealing layout, with features like icons representing weather conditions and temperature units toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
